## Description
This is a employee directory app that lets users get information on fictionla employees. It was created to demonstrate my comfort and fluency with REACT. All data is loaded via randomuser.me's API, at which point the user can soert the employees by first name, by laste name, or by age. The user can also search for an employee with the search bar, which will dynamically update the employee list as the user types. Clicking on a user will display their profile pic, as well as any public data about them.

This app is fully responsive, and was designed with a "mobile-first" approach. It also has sufficient aesthetic.
